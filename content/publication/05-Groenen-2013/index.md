abstract: "In the project to generate DNA barcodes for all North European Lepidoptera, Mutanen et al. (2012) found two genetically distinct clusters in Phalonidia manniana (Fischer von Röslerstamm, 1839). Further investigations of the morphology and biology supported the existence of two taxa: P. manniana and P. udana Guenée, 1845. In this article the Dutch situation is investigated. The material of Ph. manniana in the collections of Naturalis Biodi- versity Center, Leiden (RMNH.INS, ZMAN) and in some of the larger private collections was examined. Also Dutch material of both species was subjected to DNA barcoding and the results are compared to the Scandinavian barcodes. Phalonidia udana appeared to occur in The Netherlands, though somewhat less in number than Ph. manniana. Both species seem to be fairly common and widely distributed in The Netherlands. Some specimens were also found amongst material collected in Hungary and France. In his overview of the Palaearctic Cochylidae, Razowski (1970) figures male genitalia from Ph. manniana, labelled as ‘Wicken, Cambridge, England, 1875’, but with the characteristics of the genitalia of Ph. udana. Based on this information, the species also seems to occur in United Kingdom."
