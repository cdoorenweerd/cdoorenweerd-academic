	abstract = {Results from a snap-shot survey of Dacine fruit flies carried out on three of the Solomon Islands in April 2018 are reported. Using traps baited with the male lures cue-lure, methyl eugenol, and zingerone, 30 of the 48 species previously known to occur in the Solomon Islands were collected. Six species are newly described here: Bactrocera allodistincta sp. nov., B. geminosimulata sp. nov., B. kolombangarae sp. nov., B. quasienochra sp. nov., B. tsatsiai sp. nov., and B. vargasi sp. nov., all authored by Leblanc \& Doorenweerd. An illustrated key to the 54 species now known to be present in the country is provided.},
