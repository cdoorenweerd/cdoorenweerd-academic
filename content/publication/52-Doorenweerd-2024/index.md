abstract: "The	utility	of	a	universal	DNA	‘barcode’	fragment	(658	base	pairs	of	the	Cytochrome C Oxidase I [COI] gene) has been established as a useful tool for species identification, and widely criticized as one for understanding the evolutionary history of a group. Large amounts of COI sequence data have been produced that hold promise for rapid species identification, for example, for biosecurity. The fruit fly tribe Dacini holds about	a	thousand	species,	of	which	80	are	pests	of	economic	concern.	We	generated	 a COI reference library for 265 species of Dacini containing 5601 sequences that span most	of	the	COI	gene	using	circular	 consensus	 sequencing.	 We	compared	 distance	 metrics versus monophyly assessments for species identification and although we found	a	‘soft’	barcode	 gap	around	 2%	pairwise	 distance,	the	exceptions	 to	this	rule	 dictate that a monophyly assessment is the only reliable method for species identification.	We	found	that	all	fragments	 regularly	used	for	Dacini	fruit	fly	identification	 >450 base	pairs	long	provide	 similar	resolution.	11.3%	of	the	species	 in	our	dataset	 were	 non-	monophyletic	in	a	COI	tree,	which	is	mostly	 due	to	species	 complexes.	We	conclude	with	recommendations	 for	the	future	generation	 and	use	of	COI	libraries.	 We	 revise the generic assignment of Dacus transversus stat. rev. Hardy 1982, and Dacus perpusillus stat. rev. Drew 1971 and we establish Dacus maculipterus	White	1998	syn.	 nov. as a junior synonym of Dacus satanas Liang et al. 1993.
