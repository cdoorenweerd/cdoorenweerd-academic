Examples include the Oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis), carambole fruit fly (B. carambola), peach fruit fly (B. zonata), olive fruit fly (B. oleae), and melon fly (Zeugodacus cucurbitae). Accurate identification is the first step in generating and unlocking information on their distribution, host use, seasonal abundance, control, and management.
