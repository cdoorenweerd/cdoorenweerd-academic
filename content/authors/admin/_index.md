My research focuses on understanding the mechanisms that drive the evolutionary diversification of insects in relation to their environment.

Genetic (DNA) work is at the basis of most projects, where we aim to find and use markers that distinguish pest species from non-pests, find patterns of insect-plant relationships or unravel recent and historic hybridization events. Methods range from field collecting, morphological study to Sanger sequencing, genotype-by-sequencing (GBS), double-digest restriction enzyme association DNA sequencing (ddRAD), whole-genome-resequencing (WGS), highly multiplexed amplified sequencing (HiMAP), and all their associated bioinformatic pipelines.

Although evolution is often talked about as if it was something of the past, it is in fact everywhere and always ongoing. We are finding more and more evidence for highly dynamic ecosystems on earth, with species migrating, range expansions and contractions, and adaption, with all the associated ecological consequences. Change is the norm. Especially in pest management, and delicate island ecosystems such as in Hawaii, we find that balances can shift in a matter of decades, sometimes with extinctions as a consequence. My research aims to build a basis to understand the underlying processes, ultimately allowing sustainable landscape management towards a biodiverse future.
