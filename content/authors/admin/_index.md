My current research focuses on understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that drive the diversification of a group of about one-thousand species of fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae).

Genetic work is at the basis of most projects, where we aim to find markers that distinguish pest species from non-pests, and unravel patterns of recent and historic introgression and hybridization by closely related species using genomics. The methods include genotype-by-sequencing (GBS), double-digest restriction enzyme association DNA sequencing (ddRAD), whole-genome-resequencing, highly multiplexed amplified sequencing (HiMAP), and all their associated bioinformatic pipelines.

We have successfully applied this data to establish the phylogenetic relationship of over 300 species, map genetic markers across the genomes, estimate levels of introgression amongst confused pest species along a reference genome and establish diagnostic markers to quickly and reliably identify pest species. Potential pest specimens are regularly intercepted in fruits at ports or captured during biosecurity surveillance programs in California and Florida, and have potentially devastating effects to their agriculture.
