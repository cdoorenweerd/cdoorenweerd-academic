Evolution is always and everywhere. Although it is often talked about as if it were something of the past, evolution is continuously ongoing in all life and my research focuses on how this extraordinary force has led to the diversity of species we find on the planet - and what that means for the future.

To reconstruct and understand the tree of life, my research uses DNA data derived from targeted markers, random single-nucleotide-polymorphisms or whole genomes to understand the relationships between species and how different morphologies and ecological adaptations evolved through time. This data can then also be applied for practical purposes, such as pest recognition for agriculture.
